# COVID-TRACKER

### To run:
<p> 1. npm i </p>
<p> 2. npm run start </p>


### What this does?

<p> This is a Web app built using React. The main use of this app is to show the number of COVID-19 cases daily and total on a coountry-wise and worldwide basis.
<p> The map is made by using Leaflet in React. The table shows the country with the most number of cases till the least. The data is fetched from disease.sh API.

### Next Steps
